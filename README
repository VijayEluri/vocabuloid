Vocabuloid is a simple flash card application for Android-based mobile phones. It uses the http://tuvocabulario.com service as JSON data back end.

It uses the signpost library for OAuth. You need signpost-core and signpost-commonshttp4 for compilation to work. Both jars are available at http://code.google.com/p/oauth-signpost/downloads/list

If you're just looking for a binary to install on your Android 2.x phone: The latest built is available under Downloads. Please refer to http://github.com/paceline/vocabuloid/wiki/Install-vocabuloid-your-phone if you need help installing.
